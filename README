In this repository there are Python scripts that I have used for standard shell-model calculations of nuclear structure physics. They are based on a brute-force diagonalization of a Hamiltonian matrix in the uncoupled M-scheme.

---Contents: 

-t2j2ints.py: creates files with the two-body coupled matrix elements of angular momentum J² and isospin T² operators in ANTOINE's format

-uncouple_ints.py: transforms the former coupled matrix elements to the uncoupled form. It also creates a file with the single-particle data of the configuration interaction used

-sm_diag.py: builds and diagonalizes the Hamiltonian matrix of a nucleus in consideration. It outputs the hamiltonian matrix and the first three eigenstates to files in the many-body basis that is also output.

-run_be10.sh: runs the example case of 10Be in the p shell with the CK interaction

-cki: CK interaction file 

-QQ_PP_ints.py: build the coupled two-body matrix elements of a general mix of the quadrupole and monopole (J=0) pairing interactions

-quantum_info.py: brief collection of quantum-information tools applied for nuclear structure within the shell model

-MI_plot.py: makes a pretty matrix plot of the quantum mutual information data

-requirements.txt: packages I have installed in the conda environment I use to run these scripts. Not all of them are needed

-quantum_env.yml: exported conda environment
